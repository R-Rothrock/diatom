# Diatom

**Diatom** ~~is~~ _will be_ a program capable of running the program of
one "central" computer on another "client" computer when imitating the
central computer's environment. This is accomplished with unencrypted
UDP communication and ptrace-based syscall emulation.

IMPORTANT NOTE
---

So, here's the thing: I am just one person. I have written thousands
of lines of code, and I will have to write a lot more code (the
estimation is over 25,000 lines) in order to put this project anywhere
near a finished state. Therefore, seeing as though this is a Sysiphean
task as a whole, it will not be worked on much I don't suspect. I
won't consider it dead, but it's not so much alive, either. Of course,
contributions are welcome; misery loves company!

## Installation

Can't say.

## Usage

Can't say.

## Contribution

Can't say. Prolly not tho.

## Why I called this Diatom

A [diatom](https://diatoms.org/what-are-diatoms) is a unicellular
kind of algae and is the base form of plankton. I found this close
enough (but not too close) to amoeba, as in the old [amoeba
distributed operating system
](https://cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/amoeba.html) from the 90s.
