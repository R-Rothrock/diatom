# Diatom

**Diatom** ~~is~~ _will be_ a program capable of running the program of
one "central" computer on another "client" computer when imitating the
central computer's environment. This is accomplished with unencrypted
UDP communication and ptrace-based syscall emulation.

## Installation

## Usage

## Contribution

## Why I called this Diatom

A [diatom](https://diatoms.org/what-are-diatoms) is a unicellular
kind of algae and is the base form of plankton. I found this close
enough (but not too close) to amoeba, as in the old [amoeba
distributed operating system
](https://cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/amoeba.html) from the 90s.
