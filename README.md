# Diatom

**Diatom** ~~is~~ _will be_ a interface by which a "central node" can
connect to and utilize the CPUs of other "nodes" on the network,
resulting in a linear distrubuted computation network, in which the
central node controls all other nodes. All nodes communicate with
each other via the **Diatom Superior Communication Protocol** used by
the central node and the **Diatom Inferior Communication Protocol**
used by lesser nodes for requesting assets such as files and network
sockets.

## TODO

Literally f***ing everything

 - [ ] decide whether the protocol is made on TCP or UDP (speed v
 reliability)
 - [ ] make the damn protocol
 - [ ] get a grip on runtime syscall hooking (ha ha shoot me)
 - [ ] get started on Diatom central
 - [ ] get done with Diatom central
 - [ ] get started on Diatom client
 - [ ] get done with Diaton client

### Why I called this Diatom

A [diatom](https://diatoms.org/what-are-diatoms) is a unicellular
kind of algae and is the base form of plankton. I found this close
enough (but not too close) to amoeba, as in the old [amoeba
distributed operating system](https://cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/amoeba.html).
