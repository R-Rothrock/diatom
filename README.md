## Why I called this Diatom

A [diatom](https://diatoms.org/what-are-diatoms) is a unicellular
kind of algae and is the base form of plankton. I found this close
enough (but not too close) to amoeba, as in the old [amoeba
distributed operating system
](https://cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/amoeba.html) from the 90s.
